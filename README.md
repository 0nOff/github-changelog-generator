-  or from anywhere:

		github_changelog_generator -u github_username -p github_project
     
As output you will get `CHANGELOG.md` file with pretty *Markdown-formatted* changelog.

### Params
Type `github_changelog_generator --help` for detailed usage.

    Usage: changelog_generator [options]
        -u, --user [USER]                Username of the owner of target GitHub repo
        -p, --project [PROJECT]          Name of project on GitHub
        -t, --token [TOKEN]              To make more than 50 requests this script required your OAuth token for GitHub. You can generate here: https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
        -h, --help                       Displays Help
            --[no-]verbose               Run verbosely. Default is true
            --[no-]issues                Include closed issues to changelog. Default is true
            --[no-]issues-without-labels Include closed issues without any labels to changelog. Default is true

        -v, --version                    Print version number


### GitHub token

Since GitHub allow to make only 50 requests without authentication it's recommended to run this script with token

**You can easily [generate it here](https://github.com/settings/applications)**.

And:

- Run with key `-t [your-16-digit-token]` 
- Or set environment variable `CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN` and specify there your token. 
 		
	i.e. add to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` or any other place to load ENV variables string :

        export CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN="your-40-digit-github-token"

So, if you got error like this:
>! /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/github_api-0.12.2/lib/github_api/response/raise_error.rb:14:in `on_complete'

It's time to create this token or wait for 1 hour before GitHub reset the counter for your IP.
