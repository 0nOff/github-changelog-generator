## Examples:

- [ActionSheetPicker-3.0/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/skywinder/ActionSheetPicker-3.0/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)  was generated by command:

		github_changelog_generator -u skywinder -p ActionSheetPicker-3.0


## FAQ:
Since GitHub allow to make only 50 requests without authentication it's recommended to run this script with token

**You can easily [generate it here](https://github.com/settings/applications)**.

And:

- Run with key `-t [your-16-digit-token]` that 
- Or set environment variable `CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN` and specify there your token. 
 		
	i.e. add to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` or any other place to load ENV variables string `export CHANGELOG_GITHUB_TOKEN="your-40-digit-github-token"'`

So, if you got error like this:
>! /Library/Ruby/Gems/2.0.0/gems/github_api-0.12.2/lib/github_api/response/raise_error.rb:14:in `on_complete'

It's time to create this token or wait for 1 hour before GitHub reset the counter for your IP.
